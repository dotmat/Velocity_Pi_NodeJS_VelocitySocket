# Velocity_Pi_NodeJS_VelocitySocket
Velocity Aircraft Pi powered NodeJS Socket Server.

## Purpose
The Velocity Pi NodeJS Server is responsible for serving HTML, CSS, JS and WebSocket traffic to the aircraft. 
This server recieves new data via both HTTP endpoints and existing socket connections. 

The idea for this project is to provide a central hub where you can connect a laptop or iPad and receieve aircraft data without having to attach specialized hardware or do anything dangerous (such as open an engine cowling while the engine is running).
